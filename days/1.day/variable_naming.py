# Rule to follow:
# 1-Make your code readable 

# a.You can have multiple words in the name of your variable and separate with an underscore(because in python we use in this way).
# ex: user_name

# b. You can't have a space between.
# ex: user name = error 

# c. You can use numebers in your variables
# ex: user_name1 , user_name2 
# ++ BUT they can't be at the beginning of the name of the variable.
# ex: 1user_name, 3length = error 

# d. Don't use the name of functions, like print ,input leng(etc) for variables
